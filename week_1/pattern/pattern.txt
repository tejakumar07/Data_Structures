Key Steps for Patterns Using Nested Loops:

1)Run the outer loop:
    Count the number of lines (rows).

2)Run the inner loop:
    Focus on the columns.
    Connect the inner loop somehow to the rows.

3)Print the character (*):
    Print this inside the inner for loop.

4)Observe symmetry (optional):
    Patterns often exhibit symmetrical properties.
    The outer loop controls rows, the inner loops handle spaces and stars, and symmetry is key to aligning the pattern.
